  Many of the team at Skybound have spent the last 3 days on a positive handling
  course. We have previously been trained by Team Teach. However this time we
  decided to try a different company and used D.ESCAL8. The course was
  fantastic! The presenter Des, was amazing. We prefer to never use restraints
  with any of our clients, however there are times when we may need to be able
  to release ourselves from hair pulls, pinches, bites etc. which is the reason
  we do positive handling training. The course was excellent, it emphasised not
  using restraints and stayed focused on always building a good relationship
  with the individual. It taught us essential safety skills, but always kept the
  individual with a disability and their quality of life as the focus. There was
  no work on overpowering the individual, there was no need to with the
  techniques we were shown. The techniques focused on using movement and
  positive interactions to de-escalate serious situations. We have been
  discussing possibly putting on a course to train parents and also a course for
  self employed ABA therapists/consultants. If this would be of interest to you,
  please let us know.
