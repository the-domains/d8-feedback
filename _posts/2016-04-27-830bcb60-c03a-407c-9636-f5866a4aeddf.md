      It was extremely refreshing to have the psychological and physical impact
      of working with people packaged together. It made a huge impact on the way
      I understand the need for emotional and physical intervention. If you are
      looking for a thorough training needs analysis, delivery of a course that
      is bespoke, training that enriches service delivery, builds confidence in
      staff and moves towards the social model of care I would highly recommend
      this training.
