  I highly recommend the training to any professional who works with children
  where their presentation needs to be safely managed in such a way that
  actually supports that young person and staff. The training was very
  refreshing, providing new ways to manage a range of behaviours. This is done
  by first fully understanding the Young Persons needs through close analysis of
  ‘why’ the Young Person presents in a particular way. We were also able to link
  presentation to other issues such as sensory, communication and also routines.
  By fully understating this first, we are able to taylor our approach resulting
  in incidents being carefully and safely managed. By understanding first the
  person’s needs, we were able to taylor our approach to de-escalate before any
  physical intervention. The ethos around any physical intervention has been
  well thought out and tested. The training was delivered very well and has
  supported my ability as a practitioner so keep myself and the Young People
  safe.
