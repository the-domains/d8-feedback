  Really excellent course and Des is an exceptional Facilitator and Trainer. The
  three days were extremely challenging and thought provoking but also really
  enjoyable and clearly vital for anyone working with vulnerable individuals.
  Des puts the relationship first and his techniques help to question
  established approaches where the needs of those in the care of others is
  sometimes lost due to behaviour or environments that can be challenging.
  Highly recommend it to any employer providing care services to vulnerable
  individuals.
