  Firstly apologies for my late feedback, I wanted time to reflect and digest
  what we learnt and how it compared to previous training i have had. So: My
  previous experience of this type of training is built upon Skip and more
  recently PBM, in both cases I have managed packages of support that provide
  support to people who often found themselves in distressing situations and in
  all of my previous training we reverted to crisis management. When I first
  experienced PBM I described it as advanced compared to Skip, but essentially
  the results were the same - staff decide when somebody is in crisis and when
  to redirect them. I think the day to day work involved with PBM is spot on,
  establish primary and secondary responses to known behaviours and triggers
  does tend to keep people from distressing situations. It is the crisis
  management laden with defensive stances, that feels like a change. I never
  questioned it until d.escal8 and then it hit me like a sudden awakening. To
  treat a crisis in the same way as your prevention strategies makes this
  training truly holistic and now I have registered it it is the only way I can
  see physical interventions passing the ‘mum test’ - I would want my relatives
  treated with this level of respect. In terms of the training I felt that Des
  was outstanding, he worked hard to bring the whole group off our emotional
  baseline and then taught us how to cope and react without affecting anybodies
  dignity. Initially I felt the group were hesitant and didn’t necessarily get
  it (myself included) but by the end of day 3 we were all engaged and mopping
  it up. In a previous role I was given some really great coaching by PBM tutors
  that were very thorough in ensuring we practised techniques over and over.
  However it wasn’t until my first real incident that I used any of the
  techniques and rather predictably my training went out the window and I
  reacted in my own distress. I learnt from that and adapted my approach, but
  with all of the teams I worked with going through similar experiences I know
  that scores of people would have used unlicensed techniques and justified it
  in the name of experience. By taking us off baseline Des gave us the
  opportunity to have that first experience in a safe environment and i felt
  that the whole group went away much more emotionally self aware. Many thanks
  for an enlightening 3 day workout.
