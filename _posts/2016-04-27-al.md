  It really was one of the best training courses I have ever attended! Des was
  very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and responsive to the group and business
  needs. The biggest part for me was the ethos that came across throughout the
  course- moving into the social model of care, it is vital that staff attitude
  is genuinely person centred and considers their own conceptions about
  behaviour. De-escal8 captured this brilliantly and has improved my
  understanding of my own emotion and behaviours so that I can truly support
  individuals who display signs of distress.
