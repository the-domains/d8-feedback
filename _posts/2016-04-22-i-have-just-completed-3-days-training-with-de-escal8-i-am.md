  I have just completed 3 days training with De-escal8. I am always interested
  in innovative practice and the consideration of new approaches which this
  training certainly delivers. Des (the facilitator) has extensive real life
  experience, as well as sound underpinning knowledge all of which he imparts in
  an engaging and supportive manner. This has given me the confidence to
  continue to think ‘outside the box’ and reduced my anxiety about situations I
  might encounter. Anyone who works in the care industry or education should, in
  my opinion, do this training as a matter of course, but it will also benefit
  many other independent practitioners like myself. Thank you so much, I found
  it a hugely enjoyable and enlightening 3 days - time well spent!
