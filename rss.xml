            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many of the team at Skybound have spent the last 3 days on a positive handling course. We have previously been trained by Team Teach. However this time we decided to try a different company and used D.ESCAL8. The course was fantastic! The presenter Des, was amazing. We prefer to never use restraints with any of our clients, however there are times when we may need to be able to release ourselves from hair pulls, pinches, bites etc. which is the reason we do positive handling training. The course was excellent, it emphasised not using restraints and stayed focused on always building a good relationship with the individual. It taught us essential safety skills, but always kept the individual with a disability and their quality of life as the focus. There was no work on overpowering the individual, there was no need to with the techniques we were shown. The techniques focused on using movement and positive interactions to de-escalate serious situations. We have been discussing possibly putting on a course to train parents and also a course for self employed ABA therapists/consultants. If this would be of interest to you, please let us know.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>De-escalating with D.ESCAL8</h1><p>It has been a long break. And times have been interesting. The big update is that Archie has now finally returned to respite, and seems delighted to be back (it was very much his choice). The path back was not entirely smooth. For a while Archie's behaviour was quite simply dangerous.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fab4da12bdccaa6ed6d5479368383bb266938663.jpg"></article>]]></description>
